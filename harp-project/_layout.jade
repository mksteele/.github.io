//- Global Layout
    =========================
    This layout contains the full HTML structure of your blog and is used on
    every page. It includes all necessary components and decides which partial
    to use to render the content, depending on which page/section we're on.
    =========================

doctype
html
    head
        meta(charset="utf-8")
        link(rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/style.css")

        //- Use site name as title for blog index and post title with site name
            for everything else

        title
            if current.path[0] == 'index'
                !=sitename

            else
                | #{title} | #{sitename}

    body

        //- Include _navigation.jade as partial
        !=partial("_includes/_navigation")


        main

            if current.path[0] == 'index'

                //- If this is the blog index, simply show the content directly

                !=yield

            else if current.path[0] == 'blog'

                //- If this is part of the /blog folder, include _post.jade

                !=partial("_includes/_post")

            else

                //- Otherwise include _page.jade
